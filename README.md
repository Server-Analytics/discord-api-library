# Server Analytics discord API library
An alternative version of the well known "discord.js" library, but with more efficient and lighweight caches while also removing useless classes, methods and proprieties so your bot uses way less RAM.
This library is specifically made for Server Analytics (a discord bot), so if you want to contribute, please keep in mind to not implement new API endpoints or add more proprieties. Thanks!
Also, making some sort of documentation could be a good idea.
